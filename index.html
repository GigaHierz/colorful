        We are a group of three students participating in a Citizen Science
        course at the University of Leipzig. Citizen Science is the field of
        scientific research undertaken by the public and allows for science to
        be more accessible by including the ideas of the public rather than
        focusing on a kind of academic elitism.

      <h1 class="text11">We need You!</h1>
      <p class="text11">
        That is why we are reaching out to you: we would value your opinion and
        contribution to how we could best implement certain aspects of our
        project. We want to include as much of the community as possible.

      <h1 class="text2">What is this Project about?</h1>
      <p class="text2">
        Our project is inspired by the events of the last few months, especially
        the Black Live Matters movement. Racially-charged experiences and
        confrontations are becoming more prominently shared through various
        types of media. These experiences that we are seeing on an almost daily
        basis have captured attention on a global stage. More and more people
        are sharing their experiences through a variety of mediums on a variety
        of platforms. The goal of our project is to curate an online collection
        of artistic mediums focusing on racially-charged encounters to be used
        as a means to educate, as well as to build a community where people feel
        that they can share their own experiences and be heard and seen. We want
        to build a centralized space that focuses on this topic in particular.

        Community safety is a big concern for us. In the age of internet trolls,
        it is very easy for a post or a page to become overrun with content that
        detracts from and derails the issues. For this reason, only registered
        users will be allowed to post or comment. All contributions will be
        reviewed, and comments with racist language will be prevented by having
        a running list of unacceptable, racially-charged language. A code of
        conduct will be drafted to help guide appropriate behaviour within the
        community. Sensitive topics will also be indicated before a user can
        view the post. In the beginning, this will be manually reviewed and will
        take into consideration the desires of the community.

        In terms of user security, we want to ensure that each user feels
        comfortable with the data they are sharing with us. A user will need an
        email address to register, and this information will be encrypted. A
        registered user has the option to share their demographic data but is
        not required to do so. We want to have as little obligatory information
        as possible. Collected data might potentially be sent to educational
        reasearch institutions ( no private organizations) that focus on
        anti-discrimnation studies, but beyond that data shall not be sold to
        any third-parties.

        We want to build the app in a decentralized way. Meaning all your
        presonal data will be stored in your phone and you can decide if and
        when to share it with people you connect with. But we wont store your
        information in a centralized space. Which gives you more power and
        controll over your data.

        Our goal would be to create this platform for and with the community. So
        we will be putting a lot of effort into making the app as accessible and
        sustainable as possible. We would like to make the mobile app very
        bandwith friendly. We are planning to offer the app with multiple
        possible translations, that can also be added by the community. The
        standard for the app should be that it is accesssible to everyone. If
        you want to help with the translations please contact us or go to
        https://github.colorful.translations.com and add upload your
        translation.

        We would also like to include a section that offers further research on
        different aspects of racism, as well as historical events and figures.

      <p class="text8">
        The main idea behind the project is the educational and community
        building approach. But the collected cotribution can be used in the
        future as a data base for anti-discrimintaion studies.
      </p>
      <p class="text9">
        Another approach would be to create a database for training a machine
        learning algorithm that decets racism and hate speach to filters these
        comments. We would like to write something like this into our code of
        conduct: “If you use hate speach or dicrimating language, you are
        actively participating to train our machine learning algorihtm to detect
        this.”
